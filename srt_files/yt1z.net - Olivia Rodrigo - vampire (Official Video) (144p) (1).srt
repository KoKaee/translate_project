00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
I hate to give this satisfaction, asking how you're doing now, how's the castle built of people you pretend to care about, just what you want and

2
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:44,980
Look at you, cool guy, you got it, I see the parties and diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes, six months of torturing soul, there's some forbidden paradise, I'll love you truly

3
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:58,980
You got a laugh at the stupidity, cause I've made some real big mistakes, but you make the worst one look fine, I should have known it was strange

4
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:16,980
You only come out at night, I used to think I was smart, but you made me look so naive the way you saw me for parts, you suck your teeth into me

5
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:26,980
You're a blood sucker, fame fucker, bleedin' knee dry like a goddamn vampire

6
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:47,980
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad bad news, you called them crazy, God I hate the way I called them crazy too, you're so convincing

7
00:01:47,980 --> 00:02:01,980
I deloid without flinching, I know what I'm mesmerizing, paralyzing fucked up lips, real can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will, and for me and I hurt

8
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:15,980
Cause girls, your age no better, I've made some real big mistakes, but you make the worst one look fine, I should have known it was strange

9
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:33,979
You only come out at night, I used to think I was smart, but you made me look so naive the way you saw me for parts, you suck your teeth into me

10
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:41,979
You're a blood sucker, fame fucker, bleedin' knee dry like a goddamn vampire

11
00:02:41,979 --> 00:03:07,979
You said it was true love, but would not be hard, you can't love anyone, cause thought with me you had a heart, I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't, cause how you think is the kind of thing I'll never understand

12
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:35,979
I hate the way I called them crazy, God I hate the way I called them crazy, God I hate the way you saw me for parts, you suck your teeth into me

13
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:53,980
You're a blood sucker, fame fucker, bleedin' knee dry like a goddamn vampire
