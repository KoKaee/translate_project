00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
You're not gonna believe this, but my robot dog is finally alive.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,480
Wave to the audience, would you?

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh my gosh dude, sit down.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,640
Aw, I told you guys, the top comment would name it.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,679
Whatever you want it.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,359
With over 14,000 likes, you guys picked foam, F-O-A-M.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,760
Now, the only question I have for you guys now,

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
because I did, in fact, name him foam.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,600
What do you think foam should stand for?

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,160
And I wanted to see what he was actually capable of.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
So I took him in my living room, I pet him, and then yeah, I kicked him.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,119
Okay, but it was for science.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,119
Then I pushed him, but don't worry, he's fine.

14
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,479
He might even like it weirdly.

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,520
He's way tougher than it looks, but he's probably plotting revenge.

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
Now, I introduced foam to my actual dog, and that was a mistake.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,479
Apparently, my dog thinks foam is a threat to national security.

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,799
I think my dog hates him, but honestly, I kind of give it.

19
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,079
And then foam tried to assert dominance by jumping at her.

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,320
He can do so many different things like even climb,

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,759
but I haven't even tried that yet.

22
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,840
Let me know what else in the comments you want to see me do.
